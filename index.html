	<p> I am a lecturer (assistant professor) in Human Computer Interaction working at the University of Bath. I completed my PhD with the <a href="http://www.biglab.co.uk/people/"><em>Bristol Interaction Group</em></a>.
		My vision is to empower makers with the ability to <b>3D print interactive devices</b>. I am working on developing new methods for the 
		automated decentralised personal fabrication of displays through automated deposition and active material development. </p>
		
	<p> I have a keen interest in 3D printing and am looking to expand what we are able to achieve by approaching display fabrication using spray deposition. 
		This has led me to studying how spray painting can apply active materials to irregular surfaces and what kind of applications we can explore using
		spraying. For a short explaination of my initial research vision, please see my

	<p> In my recent peer-reviewed works, I have been working on combining 3D printing and spraying of electroluminescent paint in a usable manner ("ProtoSpray") to create 3D 
		displays with irregular shapes which can be seen in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM8d6jiQZ1w&ab_channel=BristolIGlab"><em>ProtoSpray video</em></a>. 
		This process uses combined additive manufacturing methods allowing us to empower makers to produce 3D prints with interactive embedded displays. I have also worked more recently on a
		project, "FabricatINK", which explores E ink's potential for use in personal fabrication by upcycling damaged E readers. In my current work I am investigating the potential to use interactive fabrication methods 
		and integrated design for the fabrication of interactive devices</p>
		
	<p>My academic training is in Maths and Computer Science and I have experience in software development. I am contactable on
